bads : 
1) L11 : props aren't typed
2) L27: he can't change the state like this , he should copy the
state in another variable then reset it with setState(newVariable)
3) L20 is avoidable, he should return all the jsx at once with conditional rendering
4) state should be declared with const and not let, same for the function upDateScore, target and user
5) L36 : weird call of the function updateScore, should put {updateScore} only
6) UserContext isn't declared anywhere
7) The return will not render JSX if there is no parent element to contain it

goods :

1) interface for typing the state
