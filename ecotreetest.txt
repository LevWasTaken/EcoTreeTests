bads : 
1) L11 : props aren't typed
2) he can't change the state like this, he should copy the
state in another variable then reset it with setState(newVariable)
3) L20 : is avoidable, he should return all the jsx at once with conditional rendering
4) state should be declared with let and not const, same for the function upDateScore, target and user
5) L36 : weird call of the function updateScore, should put {updateScore} only
6) UserContext isn't declared anywhere
7) The return will not render JSX if there is no parent element to contain it

goods :

1) interface for typing the state
